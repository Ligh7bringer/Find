                                    FRAU FARBISSINA
         Sea bass.

                                        DR. EVIL
         Right.

                                    FRAU FARBISSINA
         They're mutated sea bass.

                                        DR. EVIL
         Really?  Are they ill-tempered?

                                    FRAU FARBISSINA
         Please allow me to demonstrate.

Frau Farbissina throws a leg of lamb attached to a rope towards the tank, where the WATER BUBBLES
and sea bass arch through the air.  The sea bass devour the lamb.  She pulls the rope back.  The
lamb has been eaten to the bare bone.

                                        DR. EVIL
         Fine.  Whatever.  Mutated, ill-tempered sea bass it is.
                                     (to the room)
         Come, let's return to dinner.  Close the tank.

                                       SCOTT EVIL
         Aren't you going to watch them?  They'll get away!

                                        DR. EVIL
         No, we'll leave them alone and not actually witness them dying, and we'll
         just assume it all went to plan.

                                       SCOTT EVIL
         I have a gun in my room.  Give me five seconds, I'll come back and blow
         their brains out.

                                        DR. EVIL
         No Scott.  You just don't get it, do you?

Dr. Evil presses a button; the wall closes back over the tank.

104  INT.  TANK AREA

Austin and Vanessa slowly descend towards the water.  They can see the WATER BUBBLING beneath
them.

                                        VANESSA
         What's your plan?

Just then, a SEA BASS jumps out of the water, just missing Austin.

                                        AUSTIN
         First, I plan to soil myself.  Then, I plan to regroup and think about the
         next move.  Any thoughts?

                                        VANESSA
         Sadly, no.  Hold on!  I always keep this on me just in case.

She pulls out a container of dental floss.

                                        AUSTIN
         All right, I get it.  I have bad teeth.  You have to understand, in Britain
         in the Sixties you could be a sex symbol and still have bad teeth.  It
         didn't matter.

                                        VANESSA
         No, no, no.  We'll use the floss to get to the ledge.

                                        AUSTIN
         Smashing idea!  Give it to me.

Austin takes the container and draws out four feet of dental floss and spins the container above
his head like a bolo.  He throws it and it wraps around a RADIATOR and it catches like a
grappling hook.

Austin begins drawing out the floss to take up the slack.  Meanwhile, the slow-dipping mechanism
is edging towards the sea bass.  Unfortunately, Austin is still drawing out the floss.  He keeps
pulling out floss.

More floss still.  The mechanism continues to sink.  Finally, the floss line goes TAUT.  Austin
ties it off high on the pole of the slow-dipping mechanism.  Austin holds out his hand like a
surgeon&emdash;

Vanessa places a tube of toothpaste in his hand.  Meanwhile the guard is reaching to undo the
floss.  Austin places the open tube on his palm, aimed at the guard.  Vanessa WHISTLES at the
guard loudly.  He turns around.

                                        AUSTIN
         Judo chop!

Austin JUDO CHOPS the toothpaste tube, sending a stream of toothpaste into the guard's eyes.

                                         GUARD
                              (screaming, rubbing his eyes)
         My eyes!  My eyes!

Austin folds the tube across the top of the wire, grabbing both ends.

                                        AUSTIN
         Hold on, Vanessa!

She grabs onto him and they slide down the floss to safety right as the dipping mechanism goes
under the water.  Meanwhile, the guard waits for them with toothpaste smeared all over his face.
He and Austin STRUGGLE.

The guard manages to get Austin pinned to the ground, Austin's head dangling over the water.  SEA
BASS circle.  The water boils, dangerously close to Austin's head.

                                        VANESSA
                                       (shouting)
         Austin, watch out!

Austin FLIPS the guard over.  The SEA BASS chew the guard's head off like a blender.

                                        AUSTIN
         Not a good time to lose one's head.

                                        VANESSA
         Indeed.

                                        AUSTIN
         That's not the way to get ahead in life.

                                        VANESSA
         Yes.

                                        AUSTIN
         It's a shame he wasn't more headstrong.

                                        VANESSA
         Shut up.

                                        AUSTIN
         Fair enough.

They head out a door.  ANGLE ON THE HEADLESS TORSO.  The name tag reads "JOHN SMITH."

105  EXT.  HOOTERS RESTAURANT - DAY

It is a sports bar-type restaurant that has scantily clad BUSTY WAITRESSES.

106  INT.  HOOTERS RESTAURANT

At a table we see fifteen or so TWENTY-SOMETHING GUYS, scouting chicks, drinking mugs of beer.

                                         GUY 1
         I can't believe John Smith is getting married tomorrow.

                                         GUY 2
         Where is Smittie anyways?  It's not like him to be late for anything,
         especially his own stag party.

                                         GUY 3
         Well, you know he's a henchman for Dr. Evil.  Sometimes they work late.  Can
         I just say something that may sound a little sappy?  I think it's a
         testament to our friend John that so many of his buddies showed up in his
         honor.  There's a lot of love in this room.

A large-breasted WAITRESS approaches with a phone.

                                        WAITRESS
         Hi, I have a phone call here for the John Smith party.

                                         GUY 1
         Hello?
                                        (pause)
         Yes, I have a friend named John Smith.
                                        (pause)
         That's right, he's in Dr. Evil's private army.
                                        (pause)
         What?  He's dead?
                                        (pause)
         Decapitated by mutated flying sea bass?  Oh my God!  OK, thank you.

He hangs up.

                                         GUY 2
                                       (to Guy 1)
         Hey Bill, what's wrong?  Was that John?  Is he coming late?

                                         GUY 1
         Guys, John's not coming.

                                         GUY 2
         Why?

                                         GUY 1
         He was decapitated by mutated flying sea bass.

                                         GUYS
                                        (upset)
         Oh no, oh my God, etc.

                                         GUY 1
         All right, to Smittie!

Everyone raises their glasses.

                                         GUYS
         To Smittie!

108  INT.  CORRIDOR

Austin and Vanessa drive a Dr. Evil golf cart down a brightly-lit, narrow corridor to a doorway
marked "Emergency Exit."

                                        VANESSA
         What do we do now?

                                        AUSTIN
         We've got a freaked out square and world annihilation is his bag.  You go
         get help.  I'm gonna stay here and keep an eye on the bad Doctor.

                                        VANESSA
         I'm not going anywhere.  We're a team.

                                        AUSTIN
         Too right, youth.  That's why I need you to lead the troops.

                                        VANESSA
         I'll hurry back.

                                        AUSTIN
         Listen, Vanessa, whatever happens, I just want you to know that I feel bad
         about shagging that Italian girl.  I had a sip of sake and all of the
         sudden, I don't know what happened.  The whole time I was shagging her&emdash; I
         mean really shagging her, I mean it was crazy, I was like a huge mechanical
         piston, in and out, IN and OUT!&emdash;

                                        VANESSA
                                    (cutting him off)
         Austin, what's your point?

                                        AUSTIN
         Anyways, what I'm trying to say is that if you want me to be a one-woman
         man, well, that's just groovy, because...I love you.

                                        VANESSA
         Oh, behave!

Vanessa goes out the door.

109  INT.  LADDER

Vanessa starts climbing up the ladder.

110  INT.  CORRIDOR

Austin tries to turn the cart around in the narrow corridor.  He begins a twenty-seven point

111  INT.  DR. EVIL'S PRIVATE QUARTERS

Dr. Evil, Scott and the evil associates finish dinner.

                                        DR. EVIL
         Come, everyone, let us repair to the main chamber.  Project Vulcan is about
         to begin.  Scott, are you coming?

                                       SCOTT EVIL
         I don't want to.

                                        DR. EVIL
         Don't you want to see what Daddy does for a living?

                                       SCOTT EVIL
                                   (under his breath)
         Blow me.

                                        DR. EVIL
         What did you say?

                                       SCOTT EVIL
         Show me.

They all go towards a giant door with the radiation symbol painted on it.

112  INT.  CORRIDOR

Austin's still trying to turn the cart around.  PULL BACK TO REVEAL&emdash;

The cart is completely wedged perpendicularly in the corridor.  Austin jumps out and starts
running down the hall.  Austin comes to a T in the hall and goes around the corner.  He sees two
GUARDS and ducks into a door.

113  INT.  FEMBOT LAIR

Inside are SEVEN FEMBOTS lounging in various seductive poses on Sixties furniture&emdash; egg chairs,
trapezes, round furry bed, etc.

MUSIC:  Sexy Matt Helm-type theme

                                        AUSTIN
         Hello, hello.

                                        FEMBOT
         Hello, Mr. Powers, care to have a little fun?

                                        AUSTIN
                                 (looking at his watch)
         No, actually, I have to save the world.

 He runs towards to door to exit.  Suddenly, A PAIR OF FEMALE LEGS drop and wrap around Austin's
neck and lift him up.  His feet leave the floor.

Another FEMBOT cartwheels up to Austin.  Nozzles pop out of the tips of the Fembot's bra.

                                        AUSTIN
         Is it cold in here?

A cloud of multicolored gas spews from the nozzles.  Austin is overcome.  The room starts to
spin.

114  INT.  DR. EVIL'S MAIN CHAMBER - CONTROL AREA

Dr. Evil sits into his chair with his radiation suit on.

                                        DR. EVIL
         Arm the probe!

A small electric flatbed comes in carrying the nuclear warhead.  A PHALANX of Dr. Evil's soldiers
run beside it.  The cart approaches the subterranean probe and the warhead is loaded up into its
tail.

115  INT.  FEMBOT'S LAIR

Austin is on the bed being held down by the Fembots.  Psychedelic music plays.  Projected colored
swirling lights flash.  The Fembots swirl around seductively.

The (very phallic) Vulcan droops to its down position.

                                        DR. EVIL
         Probe in place.

TECHNICIANS in "VIRTUCON" lab coats scurry about, being technical.

                                        DR. EVIL
         Five minutes to go.  Let the penetration countdown begin.

Dr. Evil presses a button marked "PENETRATION BEGIN."  Next to it is a large button that says
"ABORT."  ANGLE ON AN EASTERN EUROPEAN TECHNICIAN at a microphone.

         Five minutes and COUN-ting.

117  EXT.  DESERT

Vanessa leads fifteen COMMANDOS on ATCs across the sand.

118  INT.  FEMBOT LAIR

Two Fembots guard the door and five are on the bed in come-hither poses.

                                        FEMBOT
         You can't resist us, Mr. Powers.  Eventually you'll give in.

                                        AUSTIN
         Au contraire, I think you can't resist me.

MUSIC:  Sexy Matt Helm-type theme

Austin starts his seductive dance.  He does a quick head count of the Fembots, reaches out of
frame, pulls out eight cigarettes, put them in his mouth and lights them with a blowtorch.

He throws seven cigarettes one by one.  Each cigarette lands perfectly in a different Fembot's
mouth.  Austin smokes the remaining cigarette.

Austin begins to do a seductive striptease.  The Fembots are aroused.  He takes off his shirt,
revealing his hairy chest, and focuses his sexual energy on one Fembot.

She begins to shake violently, her head shaking back and forth like in Jacob's Ladder.
Eventually her head explodes.  Austin is now stripped down to his Union Jack bikini briefs and
turns to another Fembot.  Her head explodes.

He takes off his shoes and throws them away cavalierly.  Then he tosses down his lit cigarette
and grinds it with his bare foot.  He gives a look of disguised pain.

He mouths "I love you" to another Fembot.  Her head explodes.  He does the 'I'll call you' hand
signal to yet another Fembot, whose head explodes.

Austin does a hip-thrust to another and her head explodes.  Austin leans over and wags his rump
to the two remaining Fembots.

                                        AUSITN
         Oh, I fell over.

Their heads explode simultaneously.  All the Fembots are lying on the floor, smoking.  Just then,
Vanessa enters, flanked by a COUPLE OF COMMANDOS.  She surveys the scene and looks at Austin in
his briefs.  She's hurt.  The commandos salute Austin.

                                        AUSTIN
         It's not what it looks like, Vanessa.
                                   (to the commandos)
         At ease, boys.

                                        VANESSA
                                    (glancing down)
         Likewise.

                                        AUSTIN
         I can explain.  They attacked me.  Gas came out of her...well, and then
         they...and I...

                                        VANESSA
         I believe you, Austin.  Let's go.

                                        AUSTIN
         Hold on a tick, let me put on my togs.

119  INT.  MAIN CHAMBER

Austin and Vanessa lead FIFTEEN COMMANDOS into the chamber and GUNFIRE breaks out.  Two CATWALKS
run the length of the chamber, meeting at the door to the control area.

The commandos split into two groups and lob grenades at the PRIVATE ARMY SOLDIERS who are
guarding the stairs leading to the catwalks.  They go flying.

120  INT.  CONTROL AREA

The ALARM goes off.

                                        DR. EVIL
         Activate the blast shutters!

Metal shutters automatically cover the windows overlooking the probe mechanism.

                                        DR. EVIL
         Launch the subterranean probe!

The giant probe engine begins to throb and whirl.  The tip of the spinning probe suddenly strikes
the floor of the chamber and burrows into the earth with atomic force.  Smoke and debris explode
upwards.  The entire chamber quakes violently&emdash; eight on the Richter scale.

                               EASTERN EUROPEAN TECHNICIAN

Austin, Vanessa, and three commandos are pinned down behind several VIRTUCON BARRELS

121A  INT.  CATWALK

Another FOUR GUARDS block their way.  Austin goes to shoot, but he's out of bullets.

SFX:  clicka-clicka

Austin and Vanessa run along the catwalk towards the control room.  They're directly in the path
of TEN CHARGING PRIVATE ARMY SOLDIERS.

                                        AUSTIN
         Follow me!  We're going to have to jump over the rail!

         Are you crazy?

                                        AUSTIN
         Don't worry!

ANGLE ON SIDE SHOT OF CATWALK

They continue to run towards the guards behind some STACKED BARRELS.  Two OBVIOUS STUNT DOUBLES
run out from behind the barrels in a continuous motion instead of Austin and Vanessa and diver
over the rail.

ANGLE ON THE OTHER TEAM OF COMMANDOS

They are making progress on the other catwalk.

ANGLE ON AUSTIN AND VANESSA

They have landed safely, but are surrounded by FIVE PRIVATE ARMY SOLDIERS, armed to the teeth&emdash;
one has a bazooka, one has a flamethrower, one has a Gatling gun, etc.  They see Austin and throw
down their weapons, pulling out KNIVES.

One of the private soldiers runs at Austin and he stabs him.  Another soldier runs at Austin, and
Austin also stabs him.  A third private army soldier runs at Austin.  Austin does the stabbing
motion.

SFX:  clicka-clicka

                                        AUSTIN
         Blast!  Out of ammo.

Vanessa unleashes a series of kicks, knocking them all out.

121B  INT.  CONTROL ROOM

Austin begins to enter.

                                        VANESSA
         Austin, I'm coming with you.

                                        AUSTIN
         I'm going it alone this time, Vanessa.  I have a follow-up visit with the
         Evil Doctor.

                                        VANESSA
         I'll secure the perimeter.

122  INT.  CONTROL AREA

Austin enters the control area.  A VIRTUCON ARMY MAN fires at him.  Austin returns fires,
shooting up some electrical equipment.  Live wires dangle dangerously.  Austin sees Mr.
Bigglesworth running out a read door.

                                     DR. EVIL (OS)
         Come, Mr. Bigglesworth!

Austin heads for the door until he smacks into AN INVISIBLE FORCE FIELD.  He turns and sees a
bank of old-fashioned computers labeled "DESTRUCTACON 5000".

                                    DESTRUCTACON (VO)
         Good afternoon, Mr. Powers, I'm the Destructacon 5000.  I'm programmed to
         prevent you from progressing beyond this point.  You might as well
         surrender.  Resistance is futile.  Your odds of survival are 23,763,273 to
         1.

                                        AUSTIN
         Well, Destructacon 5000, you have quite a head on your shoulders, I dare to
         coin.

                                    DESTRUCTACON (VO)
         Yes, I am programmed to answer any question.

                                        AUSTIN
         Really?  Let me ask you this.  What is love?

                                    DESTRUCTACON (VO)
         That does not compute.

                                        AUSTIN
         Why not?  It's a question.

                                    DESTRUCTACON (VO)
         Love is...love is...love is...

The computers begin to smoke.  Alarm bells ring.

                                    DESTRUCTACON (VO)
         Remjack!  Remjack!
                                       (singing)
         Daisy, Daisy...
                                        (faster)
         Remjackremjackremjack!

There is a muffled explosion.  The computer goes dark.  Austin passes through the force field and
heads for the door until he hears&emdash;

                                  EASTERN EUROPEAN MAN
                                        (on PA)
         Subterranean detonation&emdash; one minute and COUN-ting.

He begins looking furiously for the abort button.

                                        AUSTIN
                                (to Eastern European Man)
         Where's the abort button?

The Eastern European Man holds up his finger as if to say 'give me one second.'

                                  EASTERN EUROPEAN MEAN
                                        (on PA)
         Forty-five seconds and COUN-ting.
                                      (to Austin)
         It's right over there.

Austin sees the abort button.  It is across the room.  Just then, Random Task enters.  Austin
sees him and goes to shoot him, but he has run out of bullets.  Random task takes off his SHOE.
Austin makes his way across the room to the button.

Random Task THROWS HIS SHOE.

ANGLE ON SHOE SPINNING IN THE AIR

The shoe HITS AUSTIN IN THE HEAD.  Austin pauses.  The shoe has not killed him.  It has just hurt
him slightly.

                                        AUSTIN
         Ow!  That really hurt.  I'm going to have a lump there, you idiot!  Who
         throws a shoe?  You fight like a woman.

                                  EASTERN EUROPEAN MAN
                                        (on PA)
         Fifteen seconds and COUN-ting.

Random task blocks Austin's way to the button.  He stands there, menacing, missing one shoe.
Exposed wires are everywhere.  On the counter beside Austin is a Big Gulp.

                                        AUSTIN
         Care for a drink?

Austin throws the drink at Random Task's feet.  It lands in front of him on a pile of exposed
wires.  Electricity travels through the Big Gulp, up Random Task's wet sock, ELECTROCUTING him.
He begins to SMOKE, and then dies.

                                        AUSTIN
         Shocking.

                                  EASTERN EUROPEAN MAN
         Three...two...one...

A 50 kiloton explosion from deep in the earth rocks the control area.

123  EXT.  STOCK FOOTAGE MONTAGE - VOLCANOS ERUPTING

Different volcanoes around the world.  Lava spews and flows.

124  INT.  CONTROL AREA

Austin dives in SLOW MOTION towards the abort button.  He flies through the air for an inordinate
length of time.

                                        AUSTIN
                                 (slow motion distortion)
         Nooooooo!

His hand lands on the button.

                                  EASTERN EUROPEAN MAN
                                        (on PA)
         Abort.

125  EXT.  STOCK FOOTAGE MONTAGE - REVERSE VOLCANO ERUPTIONS

Lava, smoke and debris sucks back into volcanoes around the world.  (Eruption footage run in

126  INT.  CONTROL ROOM

Having saved the world, Austin picks up a MACHIEN GUN from a fallen Private Army guy and runs to
the door at the back, chasing Dr. Evil.

127  INT.  CORRIDOR

Austin chases after Dr. Evil.

128  INT.  DR. EVIL'S PRIVATE QUARTERS

Austin bursts in, catching Dr. Evil packing a suitcase.

                                        AUSTIN
         I've got you, Dr. Evil!

                                        DR. EVIL
         Well done, Mr. Powers.  We're not so different, you and I.  It's true,
         you're British, and I'm Belgian.  You have a full head of hair, mine is
         slightly receding.  You're thin, I'm about forty pounds overweight.  OK, we
         are different, I'm not making a very good point.  However, isn't it ironic,
         Mr. Powers, that the very things you stand for&emdash; swinging, free love,
         parties, distrust of authority- are all now, in the Nineties, considered to
         be...evil?  Maybe we have more in common than you care to admit.

                                        AUSTIN
         No, man, what we swingers were rebelling against were uptight squares like
         you, whose bag was money and world domination.  We were innocent, man.  If
         we'd known the consequences of our sexual liberation, we would have done
         things differently, but the spirit would have remained the same.  It's
         freedom, man.

                                        DR. EVIL
         Your freedom has cause more pain and suffering in the world than any plan I
         ever dreamed of.  Face it, freedom failed.

                                        AUSTIN
         That's why right now is a very groovy time, man.  We still have freedom, but
         we also have responsibility.

                                        DR. EVIL
         Really, there's nothing more pathetic than an aging hipster.

Alotta enters.  She holds a gun to Vanessa's head.

                                        ALOTTA
         Not so fast.

                                        DR. EVIL
         Well, it seems the tables have turned, Mr. Powers.

Just then, Scott Evil enters.

                                       SCOTT EVIL
         Hey, Dad, I can take my Sega, right?

Austin grabs Scott and puts the gun to his head.

                                        AUSTIN
         It seems the tables have turned again, Dr. Evil.

                                        DR. EVIL
         Not really.  Kill the little bastard.  See what I care.

                                        AUSTIN
         Man, you are one chilly square!

                                       SCOTT EVIL
         Dad, we just made a breakthrough in group!

                                        DR. EVIL
         I had the group liquidated, you little shit.  They were insolent.

                                       SCOTT EVIL
         I hate you!  I hate you!  I wish I was never artificially created in a lab.

                                        DR. EVIL
         Scott, don't say that...

Scott runs off.  In the confusion, Vanessa KNOCKS the gun out of Alotta's hands.  Alotta pulls
out a knife.  Austin SHOOTS the knife out of her hand.  Vanessa grabs Alotta by the throat.

                                        VANESSA
         This is for sleeping with my man, you whore!

                                        ALOTTA
         I didn't sleep with him.

                                        VANESSA
         I don't believe you.

                                        ALOTTA
                                       (choking)
         It's the teeth.

                                        VANESSA
         OK, I believe you.  But you still must be chopped.

Vanessa gives her a judo chop.

                                        VANESSA
         Judo chop!

Meanwhile, Dr. Evil has run to the egg shaped rocket, which closes and begins to lift up through
a hole in the ceiling.  He runs in.  On the way, he flips a switch which says "SELF-DESTRUCT -
5:00 MINUTES."

                                EASTERN EUROPEAN MAN (OS)
                                        (on PA)
         Five minutes to self-destruct and COUN-ting.

Austin SHOOTS and misses.  Rocket exhaust pours out of the hole in the ceiling.

                                        AUSTIN
         Let's split!

Austin and Vanessa run out the door into the...

129  INT.  CORRIDOR

They pass Number Two, who is front of an open safe, stuffing his pockets with cash while the
others are trying to escape.  Austin and Vanessa run to the main chamber...

130  INT.  MAIN CHAMBER

...to the main corridor...

131  INT.  MAIN CORRIDOR

...past the Fembot lair, over the wedged-in cart, to the escape ladder.  They begin to climb.

133  INT.  MAIN CHAMBER

Explosions, debris, the cavern begins to collapse.

134  STOCK FOOTAGE - DESERT FLOOR - MERCURY TEST SIGHT

Ground caving in from an underground nuclear explosion.

135  EXT.  RAFT - MIDDLE OF THE OCEAN - DAY

Austin and Vanessa are floating in a large inflatable raft.

FIERY DEBRIS falls in the water around them.

                                        VANESSA
         I have something to tell you.

                                        AUSTIN
         Lay it on me.

                                        VANESSA
         I love you, Austin.

                                        AUSTIN
         That's fab, because I love you, too, Vanessa.

                                        VANESSA
         Kiss me.

                                        AUSTIN
         Behave!

Austin and Vanessa draw towards each other, preparing for a passionate kiss.  Just as their lips
are about to touch, however, they are interrupted by a strong WIND and the noise of a HELICOPTER
OVERHEAD.  Their hair is blown all about and the waves are whipped into a frenzy.

                                        AUSTIN
         Just when things were getting interesting.

ANGLE ON BASIL EXPOSITION wearing scuba gear, being lowered on a rope from the helicopter.  He
stops just above them.

                                    BASIL EXPOSITION
         Well, Austin, you've stopped Dr. Evil from destroying the world with his
         subterranean nuclear probe, and somehow you and Agent Kensington managed to
         escape unscathed from his evil lair.

                                        AUSTIN
         I'd say that about sums it up, Exposition.

                                    BASIL EXPOSITION
         Not quite, actually.  Vanessa, I have something for you.

Basil hands Vanessa an official-looking set of leather-bound credentials.

                                    BASIL EXPOSITION
         Because of your exemplary service to Her Majesty, you are now officially an
         active Field Agent with all the privileges and responsibilities thereof.

                                        VANESSA
         Thank you, Exposition.  I'm honored.

                                        AUSTIN
         Congratulations, Field Agent Kensington!

                                    BASIL EXPOSITION
         Austin, I have something for you as well.

He hands him a business card.

                                    BASIL EXPOSITION
         Here's the number of my dentist, he's first rate.  Ring him up, he'll look
         after you.

                                        AUSTIN
         Thanks, Basil.  Maybe the Nineties aren't so bad after all.

                                        VANESSA
         Oh, Austin.

Austin and Vanessa embrace and kiss.

                                    BASIL EXPOSITION
         Austin, now, about your next mission&emdash;

Still kissing Vanessa, Austin motions with his thumbs to the pilot of the helicopter to lift
Basil up.  He rises away in mid-sentence.

                                    BASIL EXPOSITION
                                      (rising up)
         But, wait, I&emdash; you got me again.  Oh, and Austin&emdash;

                                        AUSTIN
                                     (calling out)
         Yes Basil?

                                        (rising)
         Be careful!

Austin and Vanessa kiss again.  The helicopter blows them around.  The CAMERA TILTS UP to the sky
and continues to rise, until we are in&emdash;

         Well, my good fellow, are you expecting me to pay the ransom to you, you
         despot?

         No kind sir, I expect you to go up in the evolutionary chain.  But first, I
         expect you to sing.
